# Memory-Game
The memory game is for single player.
In this game, a menu where the player writes his name and the amount of pairs of cards he wants to have in the game (maximum 30).
After the registration, you go to the game screen, where there is a timer that measures the time until the end of the game.
The player may turn over only two cards in each try, if they match, they will remain upside down.
The game ends when the player manages to turn over all the cards and then the clock stops.
At any point in time the player has the option to pause the game, restart the game or return to the menu screen.
